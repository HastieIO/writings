# The Certification That Wasn’t Supposed to Matter  
*May 2025*

I knew what people said about the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) cert before I even started.

> “That’s not a real cert.”  
> “It won’t get you a job.”  
> “It’s just marketing.”

And to be honest? They weren’t wrong.

On paper, the ISC2 CC is an entry-level certification — broad, surface-level, and introductory. It’s not technical. It won’t teach you how to pentest or write detection rules or secure cloud infrastructure. It won’t impress senior engineers or land you a six-figure offer.

But I didn’t take it to impress anyone.

I took it for me.

## Why I Took It Anyway

After months of teaching myself security — bouncing between blog posts, YouTube, online labs, and Reddit — I started to lose track of what I actually knew.

Every time I learned something new, I discovered ten more things I didn’t.  
Every time I felt confident, a new concept or tool would shake it.  
Every time I saw someone else post about their certs or job offers, I felt that same sinking doubt.

Imposter syndrome didn’t whisper — it screamed.  
It told me I was behind. That I didn’t belong. That maybe I was just pretending to be someone I wasn’t smart enough to become.

So I signed up for the CC exam.  
Not to prove anything to others — but to prove something to myself.

## What It Gave Me

Studying for the CC wasn’t glamorous. It wasn’t deep. But it was focused. It helped me make sense of the chaos in my head.

It organized what I already knew:  
- Core security principles  
- Access control and IAM  
- Risk management  
- Incident response  
- Governance and compliance  

It gave me structure.  
It reminded me that security isn’t just alerts and hacks — it’s about protecting people and managing risk. It’s about trust, accountability, and making decisions that matter before the breach ever happens.

## What It Meant

When I passed, I didn’t feel pride. I felt **relief**.  
Not because I unlocked anything magical — but because I finally had something tangible. Something to point at and say,  
**“You do know this. You’re not lost.”**

It quieted the noise in my head, even if only for a moment.  
It gave me just enough confidence to keep pushing forward — through the sea of tools, topics, and tabs I still didn’t understand.

## Final Thoughts

Was the CC a “real” cert?  
Maybe not in the way the internet defines it.  
But for me, it was a milestone. A breath of air. A small anchor in a field that too often feels like open ocean.

And sometimes, that’s enough to keep swimming.
