# ✍️ Writings – Tech, Security, and Growth

Welcome to my writing corner — a collection of thoughts, rants, and reflections as I navigate IT, cybersecurity, internships, and self-study.

These aren’t polished tutorials or LinkedIn-ready essays. They’re raw, personal, and sometimes chaotic — kind of like learning itself.

## 📚 Sections

- **internships/** — Real talk from the trenches
- **learning/** — Stuff I’ve broken and fixed

Each post is written for me first — to reflect, process, and grow. But if it helps you too, that’s even better.
