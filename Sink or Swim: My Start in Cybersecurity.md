No Bottom in Sight  
April 25, 2025

I haven’t been gaming lately. Not because I don’t love it — but because something in me shifted. Something quiet, but undeniable. There comes a point where distraction feels dishonest. You start looking at the hours you’ve spent trying to escape, and you realize you’re not just avoiding boredom — you’re avoiding yourself. So for the past couple of weeks, I’ve been sitting with that. With me. With where I am, and where I want to be. And I made a choice: to start swimming toward something that scares me — cybersecurity.

At first, it felt exciting. Like starting a new game on the hardest difficulty. I thought I’d download some labs, spin up some virtual machines, maybe even pop a shell or two and feel like a hacker. But it didn’t take long for that illusion to crumble. Because cybersecurity isn’t something you just jump into. It’s not a skill — it’s a stack of disciplines, each with its own depth. You don’t just learn how to break into a system. You learn how it was built, why it’s vulnerable, how to defend it, how to recover it when it’s breached, and how to explain it to someone who’s never opened a terminal.

This field is an ocean. And the further you go, the darker it gets. You start with IT fundamentals — operating systems, file systems, networking, permissions, support workflows. Then you dive into Windows internals, Active Directory, LDAP, GPOs, patching, account provisioning, identity federation. Then there’s the cloud: IAM roles, Azure AD, blob storage, key vaults, Terraform, misconfigurations. Add Linux, scripting, security frameworks, vulnerability management, monitoring tools, SIEMs, forensics, compliance, incident response, social engineering, zero-day exploits — the list doesn’t end. You study one thing and discover five more you’re missing. You feel like you’re making progress, but the ocean just gets wider.

And here's what no one tells you when you're starting out: the knowledge is heavy, but it’s not the hardest part. What really crushes you is the silence. The part where you sit alone in your room, screen lit, exhausted, and still wondering why that script won’t run. The part where you spend two hours debugging a simple misconfiguration, only to realize it was one missing character in a config file. The part where you log onto LinkedIn and see people posting new certs, job offers, victories — and you feel like you're stuck in place, gasping for air while everyone else is flying.

There’s no map for this. No straight path. Just you, trying not to sink under the weight of expectations — mostly your own. And on the worst days, you feel useless. You question why you ever thought you could do this. You wonder if you’re wasting your time, your potential, your future. You wonder if you should’ve picked something easier. Something with clear steps and predictable outcomes. Something where you could breathe.

But here’s the thing: I’ve already come too far to turn back. I’ve tasted what it feels like to make something work. To solve a problem on my own. To understand why an attack succeeded — and how to stop it next time. That feeling doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s electric. It’s like surfacing for a moment, just long enough to breathe, before going under again with purpose. And maybe that’s all this field is — swimming through a sea that doesn’t end, learning to survive in the depths.

People talk about imposter syndrome like it’s a buzzword. For me, it’s the quiet panic that follows me into every project. It’s the voice that says “you’re not smart enough” when I open a new tool. It’s the doubt that creeps in when someone asks me to explain what I’m working on. And yet, I keep going. Not because I’m fearless — but because I refuse to let that voice win. I’ve failed enough times to know that failure isn’t the end. It’s the beginning of clarity. Of progress. Of strength.

I’ve learned that security doesn’t reward perfection — it rewards endurance. The people who succeed aren’t always the smartest. They’re the ones who stayed in the water when it got cold. The ones who built their lungs, stroke by stroke. The ones who sank a hundred times, but kept rising.

I won’t pretend to be there yet. I’m still deep in the current. Still figuring things out. Still overwhelmed. But now, when I feel like I’m drowning, I remind myself: this is how you grow. Not by floating — but by learning to move in the weight. There may not be a bottom to this ocean, but I’m not looking for one anymore. I’m not trying to reach the end. I’m trying to belong here. And every day I show up, I do.

So if you’re reading this, and you feel like you’re barely keeping your head above water — keep swimming. Not for the certs. Not for the title. Not for the money. But because something inside you knows that this struggle means something. That who you become through it is worth the pain. That staying afloat — even when you’re gasping — is an act of defiance. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll learn to breathe down here like I’m trying to.

This field may never get easier. But I will get stronger. And I will keep going. Because I’ve chosen this ocean. And I’m learning to swim like I belong in it.
