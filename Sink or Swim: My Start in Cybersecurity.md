# 🌊 No Bottom in Sight  
*May 9, 2025*

Lately, I haven’t been gaming.  
Not because I’m too busy — but because the fire in me changed.  

For the past two weeks, I’ve been fully submerged in **cybersecurity**, trying to hold my breath and swim deeper.  
But this field isn’t a swimming pool.  
It’s the open ocean.  
And if there’s a bottom? I wouldn’t be able to see it — not from here.

## 🧠 The Weight of the Water

Security isn’t just hard.  
It’s *dense*.  
You don’t just learn tools — you learn systems.  
You learn how everything breaks, why it breaks, how to defend it, and how to explain it all to people who barely speak your language.

It’s the basics of IT — networking, OS concepts, sysadmin work, enterprise infrastructure.  
Then it’s layered with identity, compliance, logging, threat detection, digital forensics.  
And that’s before you even get to real-world pressure — where mistakes mean breached data, lost trust, actual consequences.

The deeper you go, the darker it gets.  
And yet, you keep swimming.

## 💾 This Isn't Just Tech — It’s Trust

What we protect isn’t just 1s and 0s.  
It’s **people’s secrets**.  
It’s their lives in digital form.

We carry passwords, social security numbers, banking records, private conversations, medical reports — all of it fragile and all of it vital.  
And the world trusts us — *expects us* — to keep that floodgate sealed.

That pressure sits on your chest like water when you're too far from the surface.  
And still… we dive.

## 😔 The Quiet Drowning No One Talks About

What no one prepares you for is how **lonely** it can feel.  
You scroll through LinkedIn and see certs, titles, smiling posts.  
But behind the scenes?

- You’re second-guessing yourself daily  
- You’re stuck in documentation that makes no sense  
- You’re pushing through burnout just to feel “caught up”  
- You’re swimming in circles, trying to find ground that doesn't exist  

And then imposter syndrome hits like a rip current — invisible, fast, and unforgiving.

Some days, I don’t feel like I’m learning.  
I feel like I’m **drowning quietly** while everyone else floats.

## 🪨 The Choice

But here’s the part I keep coming back to:

If you stay at the surface, you’ll never know what you're capable of.  
If you want to find clarity, you have to go deeper.  
Even when it hurts.  
Even when your lungs are screaming.

Because that pressure?  
That resistance?  
That’s where transformation happens.

## ✍️ Final Note to Self (and Maybe You Too)

This career doesn’t hand out life vests.  
No one gives you air.  
You learn to breathe differently — or you don’t survive.

So I’m not here to coast.  
I’m here to build a life, one brick at a time, even if I have to do it underwater.

If you're out there, feeling the same weight?

> You’re not weak for struggling.  
> You’re not behind.  
> You’re just swimming in a sea that was never meant to be easy.

Keep going.  
Even when there’s no bottom in sight.
